# php-template
Template rendering abstraction library. Abstract your libraries from specific templating engines.

This library provides the TemplateInterface, which is the abstraction of any data rendering template.
And it also provides one simple implementation called OutputBufferTemplate, which renders the data using another PHP script and PHP ob_* functions.

# Contribution

If you create a library that depends on this one and you use composer, please consider the following:
* If you implement the TemplateInterface, please place "slepic/php-template-implementation" in the provide section of your composer.json. This will allow people to see which template rendering engines have been abstracted using this library.
* If you consume the TemplateInterface, please place "slepic/php-template-consumer" in the provide section of your composer.json. This will allow people to see that your project decided to use this library to abstract itself from concrete template rendering engines.
